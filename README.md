### Introduction: 
---
This is a project work given to me after completing my Ten weeks Data Analysis bootcamp with Incubator Hub under the Umbrella of Ladyâ€™s In Tech Africa (LITA). Itâ€™s to analysis sales of Product based on top performing product, Months and Regional breakdown for the period of two years. 

### Data Source1:
---
The Data source used in this project is Sales Data, an Excel file containing just a table with fifty thousand rows and seven columns that was sent across the bootcamp by my Data Analysis Instructor (Mr. Temidayo TeeDee). ðŸ˜„

### Tools Used1:
---
- Microsoft Excel to calculate the Revenue column, Pivot table to Analyze the data.
- SQL to query and manipulate the data.
- Power BI to visualize.
- GitHub for portfolio building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations1: 
---
I started the data cleaning and preparation as follows:
- Data loading and inspection on Microsoft Excel 
- Multiplying Quantity by Unit Price, Revenue was calculated. 
- Data loading and inspection on SQL
- Querying and manipulation of the table
- Data loading and inspection on Power BI.

### Problem Statement:
---
- The total revenue for each product category.
- Number of sales transactions in each Region.
- Highest selling product by total revenue.
- Monthly total revenue.
- Top 5 customers with total purchase amount.
- Total revenue by product, Region and Month.

```

Retrieve the total sales for each product category

 ```SQL
 select Product, Sum(Revenue) Total_Sales
  from capstone_salesdata
  Group By Product
  Order By Total_Sales Desc
```

Find the number of sales transactions in each region 

  ```SQL
  select Region, sum(Quantity) Sales_Transaction
  from capstone_salesdata
  Group By Region
  order by Sales_Transaction desc
```

Find the highest selling product by total sales value

  ```SQL
  select Product, SUM(Revenue) Total_Sales
  from Capstone_SalesData
  Group by Product
  Order by Total_Sales Desc
```

### Tools Used2:
---
- Microsoft Excel to calculate subscription duration column, Pivot table to analyze the data.
- SQL to query and manipulate the data.
- Power BI used to add a conditional column and then visualization.
- GitHub for portfolio building.

### Data Cleaning And Preparations2: 
---
I started the data cleaning and preparation as follows:
- Data loading and inspection on Microsoft Excel 
- Using the difference between subscription end and subscription start, subscription duration column was calculated.

    = [SubscrptionEnd] â€“ [SubscriptionStart]
 ```
```POWER BI
   If Canceled = "TRUE", then output 1
   Else 0
```
Retrieve the total number of customers from each region
```SQL
   Select Region, count(CustomerID) Customer_Count
   From Capstone_CustomerData
   Group By Region
   Order By Customer_Count Desc
```
Find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers
```SQL
   Select SubscriptionType, count(CustomerID) Customer_Count_Subscription
   From Capstone_CustomerData
